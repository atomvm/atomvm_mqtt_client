# AtomVM MQTT Example Program

The `mqtt_example` program illustrates use of the MQTT API by connecting to a well-known MQTT broker, and sending and receiving a message on a topic every 5 seconds.  Results are displayed on the console.

> Note.  Building and flashing the `mqtt_example` program requires installation of the [`rebar3`](https://www.rebar3.org) Erlang build tool.

Build the example program and flash to your device:

    shell$ cd .../AtomVM/src/platforms/esp32/components/atomvm_mqtt/examples/mqtt_example
    shell$ rebar3 esp32_flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0

> Note.  This build step makes use of the [`atomvm_rebar3_plugin`](https://github.com/fadushin/atomvm_rebar3_plugin).  See the `README.md` for information about parameters for setting the serial port and baud rate for your platform.

Attach to the console using the `monitor` Make target in the AtomVM ESP32 build:

    shell$ cd .../AtomVM/src/platform/esp32
    shell$ make monitor
